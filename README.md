# pledgeform
#A simple pledge app form that was built in Django. 
#You may view the form at http://timborrego.pythonanywhere.com/pledge/

#The user is prompted to enter their name, email, and a pledge amount. A thank you message is displayed with the users first name and amount. It is also possible to send a confirmation email once email settings are configured in the settings.py file. However, it is not currently enabled to avoid spamming anyone.
